<!-- Pull-To-Refresh -->
<p>
<a name="refresh"><strong>Pull-To-Refresh</strong></a>
<br />
Swipe downward in a scrolling motion to activate the Pull-To-Refresh feature. This causes information for the current
user to be fetched from the Silent Circle servers, for example, to fetch the user's photo. (See User Photo for more)
</p><p>
Note that fetching information from servers may take more or less time, depending on network conditions.

<!-- User Photo -->
<p>
<a name="userPhoto"><strong>User Photo</strong></a>
<br />
The user photo may come from several different sources, by priority:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Added by you in the Edit view.</strong>
        <br />
        Tap Edit button at top right of the contact info view, then tap the photo in the Edit view. You will be 
        presented with options to take a photo (if device camera is available), or choose photo from Photos library. 
        This is the top priority photo.
        <br />
        Note that you may also delete a photo, in which case, the photo displayed will fall back to a lower priority
        photo if available.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The photo linked to this Silent Contact from your system Contacts.</strong>
        <br />
        If the current user photo has been linked to a Silent Contact user from a system Contacts user, this will be
        the preferred photo until you add a new as described before.
    </li>
    <li><strong>A photo the user has uploaded to their Silent Circle account settings web page.</strong>
        <br />
        If the current user has uploaded a photo, Pull-To-Refresh will fetch their photo from the web. This photo is
        the "last resort" lowest priority photo to be displayed.
        <br />
        Note that if you add a photo for this user and then delete it, the web photo will be displayed if available.
    </li>

<!-- Phone Icon -->
 <p>
 <a name="phoneIcon"><strong>Phone Icon</strong></a>
<br />
 Tap the phone icon to switch to the Silent Phone app, if installed on this device, ready to place a call to this user.
 </p>
 <p align="right"><em><a href="#top">top</a></em></p>

<!-- Message Icon -->
<p>
<a name="messageIcon"><strong>Message Icon</strong></a>
<br />
The action resulting from a tap on the Message Icon depends on where you are in the app. 
</p><p>
In the Messages view of a conversation, you can tap on the conversation title for the Conversation Details view.
Then a tap in the area of the user name/photo will present the User Info view. Also in the Messages view of a 
conversation, a tap on the security button at top right will present the Conversation Security view which also navigates
to the User Info view in the same way.
<br />
In either case, tapping on the Message Icon will simply return you back to the Messages view from where you started.
</p><p>
If you arrive at the User Info view by tapping a contact in the Silent Contacts view, a tap on the Message Icon will 
attempt to pop you into the Messages view of a conversation with that user if there is an existing conversation, or
will start a new conversation with the selected user.
