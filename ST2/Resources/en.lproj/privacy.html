<h2>Silent Circle Privacy Policy</br>
    <small>Transparency and Trust</small></h2>

<p>
Our business is to encrypt and secure your communications. We take this very seriously. The physical security of our servers, networks, and equipment is equally as important as data security. That is why we own, control, and when necessary, custom-build our own equipment as well as employ the strictest security measures. The protection of your communications is what we do best.
</p>
<p>
Accepting payments may require us to collect of some very basic personal data such as email addresses and card information. This payment information is only shared with our payment processor, and only to complete the transaction and get you in the Circle. We do not hold your credit card information. We want to hold the least amount of data as possible.
</p>
<p>
Silent Circle does not log any information associated with voice or video calls, messages sent over Silent Text. We do not log any authenticated web requests. The logs generated from other web traffic do not include any identifying information. We delete logs that other services generate in 7 days or less. We turn the logging level on our systems to log only protocol-related errors. Our goal is to have nothing to turn over or disclose to any third party.
</p>
<p>
You may notice that the pages on our main web site pull in javascript files from a third party. This allows our web developers and salespeople to know which pages are being looked at, and how to make information easier to find for our enterprise customers. In discussions with the third party, we are convinced that the information being used is the minimum possible, and that it is being handled with the appropriate care.
</p>

<p>Transparency is important. Every 6 months we will post:
<ul>
	<li class="arrow-list">How many requests from worldwide law enforcement we receive. </li>
	<li class="arrow-list">How many customers this involved. </li>
	<li class="arrow-list">What agency or organization made the request. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Your privacy is dependent on the proper handling of your personal information. We will never sell this data or give access to unauthorized third parties. If requested, you can be assured we will delete your information completely from our records. We will update the accuracy and currency of this privacy statement as needed. We want it to reflect our goals and aspirations to help you. We also want it to accurately describe what we can and cannot do. We are a secure encrypted communications service, answering to our customers: the citizens of the world. If you feel your privacy has been violated by your use of Silent Circle, you may register your complaint by emailing  <a href="mailto:security@silentcircle.com">here.</a>
</p>
<p>
We support your right for secure private communications, however some people will use our tools and service to do bad. We don't want that - its bad for everyone and makes our job harder. We reserve the right to cancel your service for doing bad things.
</p>
<p>

Your trust is a privilege that we will work to earn every day with a relentless focus on security, simplicity, and service. Welcome to the Circle.
