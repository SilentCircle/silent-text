<!-- SAS Verified? -->
<p><a name="sasVerified"><strong>SAS Verified?</strong></a>
<br />
This means "Have you verified the SAS phrase with the person you're chatting with?"
</p>
<p>
Verifiying the SAS phrase completes the highest level of three possible levels of security. The first two levels of
security have to do with the encryption keys exchanged between your device and your conversation partner's device. This
happens behind the scenes to keep your conversations secure.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you can verify the SAS phrase with your conversation partner in person. This can be done a number of ways.
For example, you might phone them with the Silent Phone app or with a blackphone&#0153;. You can be certain by talking
to them they are the person you expect. You can then compare the SAS phrase on your device with the SAS phrase they see
on their device. The should be exactly the same.
</p>
<p>
If the SAS phrases are not identical, this could indicate a security compromise known as a Man-in-the-middle attack,
where network communications are intercepted and someone "in the middle", is masquerading as someone you know.
</p>
<p>
By personally verifying that the SAS phrase is identical on each of your devices, you can be sure your conversation is
secured at the highest level.
</p>
<p>
When you tap "No" or "Yes" on the SAS Verified switch, you are confirming that you and your conversation partner have
compared SAS phrases and found them identical.

<!-- SAS Phrase -->
<p><a name="sasPhrase"><strong>SAS Phrase</strong></a>
<br />
A SAS phrase is a set of words which can be compared between the encrypted endpoints of a secure communication.
</p>
<p>
When a conversation is "keyed", that is, when the endpoint devices have completed a series of encryption exchanges, a
phrase is generated which is unique to that conversation.
</p>
<p>
Communication between endpoints of a keyed conversation means that the endpoint devices exchange encryption keys to be
able to decrypt the messages sent between them. Further, this security is two levels deep for each conversation. Each
individual message sent from one person to another uses unique encryption keys. This means that the conversation is
secured, and each individual message in the conversation is addtionally secured.
</p>
<p>
However, even with these two levels of security it is theoretically possible for an agent on the communications network
to attempt to intercept transmissions to masquerade as one of the endpoints. This is known as a Man-in-the-middle
attack.
</p>
<p>
The SAS phrase offers a third level of security: personal verification. The SAS phrase is never transmitted across the
communications network; it can only be derived mathematically by the "keyed" endpoints.
</p>
<p>
So when conversations must be secure to the highest level, persons may personally verifiy that the SAS phrase on their
devices is identical, whether comparing in the same physical space, or perhaps by a secure phone call.
</p>
<p>
When the comparison of identical SAS phrases is confirmed, the SAS phrase has been "verified".
