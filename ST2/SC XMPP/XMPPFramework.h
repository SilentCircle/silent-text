//
//  This file is designed to be customized by YOU.
//
//  As you pick and choose which parts of the framework you need for your application, add them to this header file.
//
//  Various modules available within the framework optionally interact with each other.
//  E.g. The XMPPPing module utilizes the XMPPCapabilities module to advertise support XEP-0199.
//
//  However, the modules can only interact if they're both added to your xcode project.
//  E.g. If XMPPCapabilities isn't a part of your xcode project, then XMPPPing shouldn't attempt to reference it.
//
//  So how do the individual modules know if other modules are available?
//  Via this header file.
//
//  If you #import "XMPPCapabilities.h" in this file, then _XMPP_CAPABILITIES_H will be defined for other modules.
//  And they can automatically take advantage of it.
//
