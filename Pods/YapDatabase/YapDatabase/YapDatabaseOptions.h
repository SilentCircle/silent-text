 * How should YapDatabase proceed if it is unable to open an existing database file

 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Fail
 *     The YapDatabase alloc/init operation will fail, and the init method will ultimately return nil.
 * 
 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Rename
 *     The YapDatabase init operation will succeed, a new database file will be created,
 *     and the corrupt file will be renamed by adding the suffix ".X.corrupt", where X is a number.
 *
 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Delete
 *     The YapDatabase init operation will succeed, a new database file will be created,
 *     and the corrupt file will be deleted.
 *
 * The default value is YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Rename.

/**
 * There are a few edge-case scenarios where the sqlite WAL (write-ahead log) file
 * could grow without bound, because the normal checkpoint mechanisms are getting spoiled.
 * 
 * 1. The application only does a single large write at app launch.
 *    And afterwards, it only uses the database for reads.
 *    This may be due to a bug in sqlite. Generally, once the WAL has been fully checkpointed,
 *    the next write transaction will automatically reset the WAL. But we've noticed
 *    that if the next write occurs after restarting the process, then the WAL doesn't get reset.
 * 
 * 2. The application continually writes to the database without pause.
 *    The checkpoint operation can run in parallel with reads & writes.
 *    Normally this is optimal, as the last write (in a sequence) will conclude, followed by a checkpoint.
 *    And then the next write will reset the WAL.
 *    But if the application never ceases executing write operations,
 *    then we have no choice but to occasionally interrupt the writes in order to
 *    allow the checkpoint operation to catch up.
 * 
 * If the WAL file ever reaches the configured aggressiveWALTruncationSize,
 * then YapDatabase will effectively insert a checkpoint operation as a readWriteTransction.
 *
 * (This is in contrast to its normal optimized checkpoint operations, which can run in parallel with db writes.)
 * 
 * Note: The internals approximate the file size based on the number of reported frames in the WAL.
 * The approximation is generally a bit smaller than the actual file size (as reported by the file system).
 *
 * It's unlikely you'd even notice this "aggressive" checkpoint operation,
 * unless you were benchmarking or stress testing your database system.
 * In which case you may notice this aggressive checkpoint as something of a "stutter" in the system.
 *
 * The default value is (1024 * 1024) (i.e. 1 MB)
 * 
 * Remember: This value is specified as a number of bytes. For example:
 * -   1 KB == 1024 * 1
 * - 512 KB == 1024 * 512
 * -   1 MB == 1024 * 1024
 * -  10 MB == 1024 * 1024 * 10
