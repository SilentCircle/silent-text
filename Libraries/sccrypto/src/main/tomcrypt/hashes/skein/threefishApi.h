/**
 * @file threefishApi.h
 * @brief A Threefish cipher API and its functions.
 * @{
 *
 * This API and the functions that implement this API simplify the usage
 * of the Threefish cipher. The design and the way to use the functions 
 * follow the openSSL design but at the same time take care of some Threefish
 * specific behaviour and possibilities.
 *
 * These are the low level functions that deal with Threefisch blocks only.
 * Implementations for cipher modes such as ECB, CFB, or CBC may use these 
 * functions.
 *

    // Initialize the context
    threefishSetKey(&keyCtx, Threefish512, key, tweak);

    // Encrypt
    threefishEncryptBlockBytes(&keyCtx, input, cipher);
