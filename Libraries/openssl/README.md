# OpenSSL-for-iOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone.png)](https://travis-ci.org/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone)

This is a script for using self-compiled builds of the OpenSSL-library on the iPhone. You can build apps with XCode and the official SDK from Apple with this. I also made a small example-app for using the libraries with XCode and the iPhone/iPhone-Simulator.

**Enjoy OpenSSL on the iPhone!**

You must build the OpenSSL-Libraries before running the sample with:
```bash
./build-libssl.sh
```

This repository contains a iOS 7.1 XCode Project with usese the OpenSSL Libaries. The examples uses the MD5 or SHA256-algorithm to calculate an md5 or sha256 hash from an UITextfield.

## System support
**iOS 4.3 - iOS 7.1 (i386, x86_64, armv7, armv7s, armv64) is currently supported.**

For iOS < 4.3 you must use iOS SDK < 6.0 and an older version of the build script.
